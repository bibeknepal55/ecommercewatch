## Search Feature Fixess

The search functionality has been updated with the following improvements:

1. Simplified search pattern to be more permissive
2. Removed case-sensitive collation requirements
3. Simplified SQL query structure
4. Fixed message handling and display
5. Added proper error logging
6. Improved input validation

The search should now work better with:
- Basic text searches
- Special characters
- Multiple words
- Case insensitive matching

If issues persist, check the error logs for specific error messages and verify the database connection settings.
